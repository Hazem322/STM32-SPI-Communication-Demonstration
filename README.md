# STM32-SPI-Communication-Demonstration
This project demonstrates SPI communication on an STM32 microcontroller, configured for both sending and receiving data. It uses DMA for efficient data handling and shows how to echo a transmitted character. Ideal for learning SPI setup and basic data exchange.
